# Smart Irrigation System using Machine Learning 🌱🤖

This project implements a **Smart Irrigation System** that uses machine learning techniques to predict whether irrigation is required based on environmental data.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts irrigation needs using a Random Forest model
- Uses a CSV-based dataset
- Visualizes the data with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Built and tested in Jupyter Notebook
- No hardware or IoT setup required

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Joblib
